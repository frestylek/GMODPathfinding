I was creating custom pathfinding without using navmesh to use it on maps with models as walkable surfaces.
This version only support 2d spaces (Only flat surfaces)

        It use a lot of ram and cpu power...

You can download it and test it.

you are free to use it anywhere and if you want to help to make it new way to finding path in gmod feel free to submit pull requests
